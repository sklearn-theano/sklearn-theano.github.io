=======================================
Drawing bounding boxes for localization
=======================================

Drawing a bounding box on a detected object is crucial to properly finding
objects in images. One very simple way to do this is by simply finding all
points with a matching classification, then creating a box using the minimum
and maximum values for X and Y of the matching points.

For more detail about how this works in detail, see the
``plot_localization_tutorial`` example.
